# Identity & Vetting Domain

## What Is This?

This is the **Identity & Vetting Domain** of Prodigi Work Hub — the backbone that answers one question:

> *"Who is this person, and can we trust them with a project?"*

Before a user can manage a project as a **Consultant** or be hired as a **Freelancer**, the platform needs to know their full professional identity. This domain captures that — from their education and certifications to their skill set, work history, and rate card.

Think of it as the user's **Passport + Resume + Reputation Score**, all in one structured layer.

---

## Why It Exists

Prodigi is not a raw marketplace like Upwork where anyone can sign up and bid. It is a **managed platform** where:

1. **Clients** submit projects and trust Prodigi to assign qualified help.
2. **Admins** vet and approve Consultants before they can manage any project.
3. **Consultants** must prove their expertise before gaining elevated permissions.

The Identity & Vetting domain is the data infrastructure that makes that vetting possible. Without it, Admins have no structured data to review, and the platform cannot perform skills-based matchmaking.

---

## How It Connects to the Rest of the Platform

  (approve       (search,    (skill/niche
  Consultants)   browse)      filtering)
```

The data in this domain is **persona-agnostic** — it does not change whether the user is currently acting as a Client or a Freelancer. It is the permanent identity layer.

## Domain Map (17 tables → 15 active)

> `linked_accounts` and `user_settings` are deliberately excluded — `user_settings` already exists as `profiles.settings` (JSONB), and `linked_accounts` requires a separate OAuth integration phase.

### Domain 1 — Core Identity *(The Passport)*

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`profiles`](#profiles) | Primary bio: name, headline, avatar, persona, location |

**Key fields added in the Identity & Vetting migration:**
- `headline` — short professional tagline (e.g. *"Senior Full-Stack Engineer"*)

---

### Domain 2 — Trust & Verification *(The Guardrail)*

> These tables are critical for the Admin to move a user from "Unverified" to "Verified Consultant."

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`user_verifications`](#user_verifications) | Tracks email / phone / identity verification status |
| [`user_identity_documents`](#user_identity_documents) | Stores paths to private KYC documents (passports, licenses) |

**Admin workflow:** When a user applies for the Consultant persona, their `user_verifications` record is checked. Admins set `status = 'verified'` for each required type. The application is **only approved** when all required types are `verified`.

---

### Domain 3 — Credentials & Authority *(The Proof)*

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`user_educations`](#user_educations) | Academic history (degree, institution, years) |
| [`user_certifications`](#user_certifications) | Professional certs (AWS, PMP, Scrum Master, etc.) |
| [`user_licenses`](#user_licenses) | Legal/trade licenses for regulated industries |

---

### Domain 4 — Skills & Taxonomy *(The Engine)*

> This is a **Many-to-Many** structure. The master `skills` table (seeded with ~40 common skills) is the single source of truth. JSONB skills on `profiles` has been migrated here.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `skills` *(existing)* | Master list of all technical/soft skills |
| [`user_skills`](#user_skills) | Links users to skills with a `proficiency_level` |
| [`languages`](#languages) | Master list of global languages (ISO 639-1, seeded with 16) |
| [`user_languages`](#user_languages) | Links users to languages with a `fluency_level` |

**Why not JSONB?** A `user_skills` join table allows queries like:
```sql
-- Find all Expert Python developers available in the Fintech niche
SELECT p.id, p.display_name
FROM user_skills us
JOIN user_specializations sp ON sp.user_id = us.user_id
JOIN skills s ON s.id = us.skill_id
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = us.user_id
WHERE s.name = 'Python'
  AND us.proficiency_level = 'expert'
  AND sp.category = 'fintech';
```

---

### Domain 5 — Work & Reputation *(The Track Record)*

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`user_experiences`](#user_experiences) | Employment history (company, title, dates) |
| [`user_portfolios`](#user_portfolios) | Past project showcases (URL, images, tags) |
| [`user_stats`](#user_stats) | Aggregated career stats (earnings, ratings, jobs completed) |

**`user_stats` is write-protected.** Only the service role (backend) can write to it. It is updated automatically when projects complete. Other users can read it for public profile pages.

---

### Domain 6 — Financial & Niche *(The Marketplace Filter)*

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`user_specializations`](#user_specializations) | Industry niches (Fintech, Healthcare, SaaS, etc.) |
| [`user_rate_settings`](#user_rate_settings) | Rate card: hourly rate, currency, availability, min budget |

---

This migration:
1. Adds `headline` to `profiles`
2. Creates 13 new tables with all constraints, indexes, triggers and RLS
3. Migrates existing `profiles.skills` JSONB data → `user_skills`
4. Drops `profiles.skills` column
5. Seeds 16 languages into the `languages` table
